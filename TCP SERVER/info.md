Project Description:
This project implements a TCP/IP network server and client application. 
The server accepts connections from clients, receives messages sent by the clients, and echoes those messages back.
 This demonstrates advanced topics in network programming, including socket programming and multi-threading.

Running Instructions:

1-)    Server: Compile the server with gcc -o server server.c -pthread and run it with ./server.
2-)    Client: Compile the client with gcc -o client client.c and run it with ./client.
